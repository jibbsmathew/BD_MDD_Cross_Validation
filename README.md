# Cross-Validation for Bipolar Disorder and Major Depressive Disorder Classification

This repository provides a dataset containing information on patients with bipolar disorder (BD) and major depressive disorder (MDD). The dataset consists of 142 rows and 46 columns, where the first 71 rows belong to patients with BD and the remaining 71 rows belong to patients with MDD. The first 45 columns represent features, and the last column indicates the label of the patients, with a value of 1 for BD and 2 for MDD.

The goal of this repository is to implement cross-validation to evaluate the performance of a classification model for distinguishing between BD and MDD based on the given features.

## Dataset Description

- Total rows: 142
- Total columns: 46
- BD patients: 71
- MDD patients: 71
- Features: Columns 1-45
- Label: Column 46 (1 for BD, 2 for MDD)

## Cross-Validation Approach

To perform cross-validation on this dataset, follow these steps:

1. Load the dataset into your Python environment using a suitable library, such as pandas.
2. Preprocess the dataset as necessary, such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling the features.
3. Split the dataset into features (columns 1-45) and labels (column 46).
4. Implement a classification model of your choice, such as logistic regression, decision trees, or support vector machines.
5. Choose a cross-validation strategy, such as k-fold cross-validation or stratified k-fold cross-validation.
6. Split the dataset into training and testing sets based on the chosen cross-validation strategy.
7. Train the classification model on the training set and evaluate its performance on the testing set.
8. Repeat steps 6 and 7 for each fold of the cross-validation.
9. Calculate the average performance metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, across all folds to get an overall evaluation of the model's performance.
